We won´t use dialogues or audionarration in the game.

The user interface will consist of a pair of 2 hands, which the player can use to interact with the different cards or pieces in the board if using oculus quest 2,
the player could also use a cardboard vr or a bluetooth gamepad aswell.

The player will be able to select the different pieces on the board, both enemies and allies to check their skills, and also select the cards in their hand to see
it´s details.

__Wish-list:__

Personal models: we are planning to use free models from the unity store, but it would be great to get our own models for the game.

Animations: add animations to the models we would make.

Music and sound effects: getting music and sound effects that fit the game theme.

Solo mode: if we have time left after finishing the multiplayer, we would like to made some kind of story or solo mode where the players can play against the AI.
