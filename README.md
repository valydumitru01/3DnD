__Wish-list:__

Personal models: we are planning to use free models from the unity store, but it would be great to get our own models for the game.

Animations: add animations to the models we would make.

Music and sound effects: getting music and sound effects that fit the game theme.

Solo mode: if we have time left after finishing the multiplayer, we would like to made some kind of story or solo mode where the players can play against the AI.
